# Bedrock Breaker  

Tired of using glitches to break bedrock? Do other mods make it too easy or too hard? BedrockBreaker is here to strike the perfect balance!  

## Features  
- Each TNT can break up to 6 blocks of bedrock (One bedrock block per face).
- TNT retains the vanilla functionality of not breaking blocks when in water - it won't break bedrock blocks when in water.
- Vanilla friendly implementation that's unlikely to interfear with other mods/data packs.

## How It Works  
1. Place TNT touching bedrock on any side (Make sure it's supported with something underneath)
2. Ignite the TNT
3. Boom!

## Incompatability list
- No known incompatabilities currently
